- Like Button - Each thought has a like button that allows users to mark thoughts they enjoy. Liked thoughts are highlighted.
- Delete Button - Each thought has a delete button to allow removal from the list.
- Add Thought - A form is provided to add new thoughts by entering a title. New thoughts are added to the top of the list.
- Liked Thoughts - A separate area tallies the number of liked thoughts and allows viewing only the subset of liked thoughts.
- Thought Count - Displays the total number of thoughts currently in the list. Updates when thoughts are added/deleted.
- Persistent Storage - Thoughts are saved to local storage to persist when the app is closed or reloaded.
